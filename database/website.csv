"The Fabric Project #announcements","892926868381110272","It looks like Mojang released new Log4j2 config files **for clients only** so far, which should resolve the issue in some cases, but certainly not for servers yet. The vanilla launcher should download and apply them automatically after a restart.

I've written a small Fabric mod to eliminate the issue for all versions at https://files.player.to/l4j_jndi_fix-1.0.0.jar but please keep in mind that it is currently only superficially tested any nobody can really know if some corner case is missing. It doesn't hurt to use this mod in addition to Mojang's and the above mitigation. Please report any issues!","https://files.player.to/l4j_jndi_fix-1.0.0.jar"
